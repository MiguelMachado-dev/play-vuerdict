        Changing my review to 1 I got bug locked because a door won't open anymore after a crash.
        The game is rich, diverse, and really innovative on some mechanics. The gameplay is really
        smooth and nice. I'm not giving 10 because I think it could benefit some QoL improvement
        like a mini map, in order to navigate without opening the map every 10 secondes to know
        where I am going. Don't ever hesitate to play it if you have the chance.
